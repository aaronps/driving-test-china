# Driving Test China Questions

**NOTE** _these questions are for older regulations, the law was changed after I got my license, this project remains for historical purposes._

On 2012 I wanted to get the Chinese driving license, I registered and got a CD with all the questions and answers to study in a couple of weeks.

Because it was so boring I decided to make a small application to run on the phone. This is a simple SPA using vanilla js, which will show you the questions and allow you to answer, most of them just requires common sense. It includes more than 1000 questions.
